A demo of Clover

## üöÄ Quick Start

Here are some quick start guidelines and commands to help you get started with the project:

### Clone the repository

Clone the Github repository to your local machine using the following command

```sh
git clone https://github.com/useclover/clover-warp
```

This should duplicate the Github repository to your preferred folder location.

### Set up your Dev env

After cloning the repository, create your `.env` file, using the format shown in `.env.example`

### Install required dependencies

After setting up your `.env`, run the following command

```sh
cd clover-warp
yarn
```

This installs all required dependencies required to run/test Clover locally.

### Start Server

Once completed, run the following command in the `clover-warp` folder

```sh
yarn dev
```

This should spin up a local server in port `3001`
Navigate to `https://localhost:3001`, and Clover should be live.

## üöÄ Features

### DAO Chats

Clover provides multi-channel chats for members of a DAO. All chats are End-to-end encrypted, and are accessible to authenticated members of a DAO.

### DAO Storage

Secure decentralised DAO storage is accessible to every DAO member. Seamlessly integrated with Filecoin, we provide seamless storage for all authenticated DAO members.

### DAO Meetings

Our integration with Hddle's dRTC makes Audio/Visual communication seamless and decentralised, with your wallet address being the only requirement.

### Voting Campaigns

DAO operations can not be complete without on-chain voting. To get this done, we make use of the FVM's capabilities, for smooth onchain voting.
